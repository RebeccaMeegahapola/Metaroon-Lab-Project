* Typescript

	* Alternative to javascript
	* TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. 
	* Allows us to use strict types
	* Supports modern features [Arrows functions, let, const]
	* Extra features [generics, interfaces, tuples]
	* TypeScript supports other JS libraries.


* Compile - tsc sandbox.ts 
* Auto compile - tsc sandbox.ts -w

* tsc --init - tsconfig.json ->
	outDir - public
	rootDir - src

* multiple ts files compile -> tsc
* compile & watch -> tsc -w

* Classes - class is a blueprint for an object

* Access Modifiers 
	1. readonly
	2. private
	3. public

* Generics
	Allow us to create reusable block of code which can be used with different types

* enums
	enums are special type in typescript which allows us to store set of constants or keywords and associate them 
	with a numeric value

	Enums in TypeScript allow you to define a set of named constants.

	An enumeration is a collection of related values that can be numeric or string values. 
	enum makes it easy to handle sets of related constants in a more readable way.

* Tuple
	Tuple types allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known

* Union
	pipe symbol (|)
